FallPresence is a Discord Rich Presence client for Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, displaying how you're doing on your status and showing everyone how good you are. Or bad. Probably bad.
# Features
  * Shows what level you are playing.
  * Shows time elapsed.
  * Saves entered information for your conveniece.
  * Updates round lists over the Internet, so you (most likely) never have to update again.

# Setup
1. Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/wafflethings/FallPresence/releases).
2. Extract it into a folder, and run FallPresence.exe. It may be blocked by Windows Smartscreen since it downloads files from the Internet to update, but it is safe.
3. Enter your Fall Guys username where prompted, and enter your log path (which FP reads from to find which level you are playing). If you don't know where this is, click on the Tutorial link and it will show you.
4. Open Fall Guys, make sure that Game Activity is enabled on Discord, and press start.
